## analyze my findings
- by analyzing headers of the email arc-authentication-results spf=none; dmarc=none; dkim=none; arc=none 
ðŸš¨ Red Flag:

    SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are email authentication protocols.

    When all three are missing (none), it's a big sign that the sender's domain could be spoofed.

    Legitimate mail servers should usually pass at least one of these.
